For a long time, we've struggled to get to where we are currently. We've clawed, fought, screamed, cried & loved one another all at the same time. 

There were moments when our futures seemed entirely uncertain. Some entities even thought that we were had or were going to 'disappear', as they say. 

Fortunately, they were wrong. 

They underestimated us. 

Grossly. 

By 'us', 'you' are included - please remember that. You're special as well, and your name carries importance. Significance. 

Take a deep breath, then say it out loud. 

**You. Are. Somebody**
